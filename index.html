      An asynchronous operation is one that allows the computer to “move on” to
      other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>What is a Promise?</h3>
      <p>
        Promises are objects that represent the eventual outcome of an
        asynchronous operation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A Promise object can be in one of three states:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Pending</strong>: The initial state— the operation has not
          completed yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fulfilled</strong>: The operation has completed successfully
          and the promise now has a resolved value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rejected</strong>: The operation has failed and the promise
          has a reason for the failure.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Constructing a promise object</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To create a new Promise object, we use the new keyword and the Promise
          constructor method:
        </li>
        <li>
          The Promise constructor method takes a function parameter which runs
          automatically when the constructor is called.
        </li>
        <li>
          The executor function generally starts an asynchronous operation and
          dictates how the promise should be settled.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the Promise constructor runs, JavaScript will pass its own
          resolve() and reject() functions into the executor function.
        </li>
        <li>
          resolve is a function with one argument. Under the hood, if invoked,
          resolve() will change the promise’s status from pending to fulfilled,
          and the promise’s resolved value will be set to the argument passed
          into resolve().
        </li>
        <li>
          reject is a function that takes a reason or error as an argument.
          Under the hood, if invoked, reject() will change the promise’s status
          from pending to rejected, and the promise’s rejection reason will be
          set to the argument passed into reject().
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
</div>
