  <ul>
    <li>
      An asynchronous operation is one that allows the computer to “move on” to
      other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>What is a Promise?</h3>
           <p>Promises are objects that represent the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A Promise object can be in one of three states:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pending</strong>: The initial state— the operation has not completed yet. </li>
        <li><strong>Fulfilled</strong>: The operation has completed successfully and the promise now has a resolved value. </li>
        <li><strong>Rejected</strong>: The operation has failed and the promise has a reason for the failure. </li>
      </ol>
    
    </li>
    <li></li>
