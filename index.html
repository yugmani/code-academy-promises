      An
      <mark
        ><code><em>asynchronous</em></code></mark

      operation is one that allows the computer to “move on” to other tasks

        What is a

      </h3>
      <p>
        Promises are objects that represent the eventual outcome of an
        asynchronous operation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A Promise object can be in one of three states:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Pending</strong>: The initial state— the operation has not
          completed yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fulfilled</strong>: The operation has completed successfully
          and the promise now has a resolved value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rejected</strong>: The operation has failed and the promise
          has a reason for the failure.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Constructing a promise object</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To create a new Promise object, we use the
          <code><em>new</em></code> keyword and the Promise constructor method:
        </li>
        <li>
          The Promise constructor method takes a function parameter which runs
          automatically when the constructor is called.
        </li>
        <li>
          The executor function generally starts an asynchronous operation and
          dictates how the promise should be settled.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the Promise constructor runs, JavaScript will pass its own
          <code><em>resolve()</em></code> and
          <code><em>reject()</em></code> functions into the executor function.
        </li>
        <li>
          resolve is a function with one argument. Under the hood, if invoked,
          <code><em>resolve()</em></code> will change the promise’s status from
          pending to fulfilled, and the promise’s resolved value will be set to
          the argument passed into <code><em>resolve()</em></code
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          reject is a function that takes a reason or error as an argument.
          Under the hood, if invoked, <code><em>reject()</em></code> will change
          the promise’s status from pending to rejected, and the promise’s
          rejection reason will be set to the argument passed into
          <code><em>reject()</em></code
          >.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>
        The Node <code><em>setTimeout()</em></code> Function
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Knowing how to construct a promise is useful</li>
        <li>knowing how to consume, or use, promises will be key.</li>
        <li>
          <code><mark>setTimeout()</mark></code> is a Node API (a comparable API
          is provided by web browsers) that uses callback functions to schedule
          tasks to be performed after a delay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code style="background-color: lightgray"><em>setTimeout()</em></code>
          has two parameters:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
            <li>a callback function and</li>
            <li>a delay in milliseconds.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Syntax:
          <code style="background-color: lightgray"
            ><em>setTimeout( callback, delay );</em></code
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Example:
          <code style="background-color: lightyellow"
            ><em>setTimeout( sayHello, 2000 );</em></code
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Here, we invoke <code><em>setTimeout()</em></code> with the callback
          function <code><em>sayHello()</em></code> and 2000. In at least two
          seconds <code><em>sayHello()</em></code> will be invoked.
        </li>
        <li>
          This delay is performed asynchronously—the rest of our program won’t
          stop executing during the delay.
        </li>
        <li>
          Asynchronous JavaScript uses something called the
          <strong>event-loop</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          After two seconds, <code><em>sayHello()</em></code> is added to a line
          of code waiting to be run.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before it can run, any synchronous code from the program will run.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, any code in front of it in the line will run. This means it
          might be more than two seconds before
          <code><em>sayHello()</em></code> is actually executed.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

      <h3>Consuming Promises</h3>

      />
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
        <li>The initial state of an asynchronous promise is <code><em>pending</em></code>, but we have a guarantee that it will settle. How do we tell the computer what should happen then?</li>
        <li>Promise objects come with an aptly named <code style="background-color: lightgray"><em>.then()</code></em> method. It allows us to say, “I have a promise, when it settles, then here’s what I want to happen…”</li>
        <li><code style="background-color: lightgray"><em>.then()</code></em> is a higher-order function— it takes two callback functions as arguments. We refer to these callbacks as handlers. When the promise settles, the appropriate handler will be invoked with that settled value.
        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>The first handler, sometimes called <code style="background-color: lightgray"><em>onFulfilled</code></em>, is a success handler, and it should contain the logic for the promise resolving.</li>
          <li>The second handler, sometimes called <code style="background-color: lightgray"><em>onRejected</code></em>, is a failure handler, and it should contain the logic for the promise rejecting.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We can invoke <code style="background-color: lightgray"><em>.then()</code></em> with one, both, or neither handler! This allows for flexibility, but it can also make for tricky debugging.</li>
        <li>If the appropriate handler is not provided, instead of throwing an error, <code style="background-color: lightgray"><em>.then()</code></em> will just return a promise with the same settled value as the promise it was called on.</li>
        <li>One important feature of <code style="background-color: lightgray"><em>.then()</code></em> is that it always returns a promise.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
